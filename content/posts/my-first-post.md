## Welcome!

This is my first blog post. I created this blog to document my **findings and learnings** as I explore new technologies, ideas, and concepts.

## What to Expect

- \U0001F4DA **Learnings** — Things I've picked up along the way
- \U0001F50D **Findings** — Interesting discoveries and research
- \U0001F6E0️ **Tutorials** — Step-by-step guides on things I've figured out
- \U0001F4AD **Thoughts** — My takes on tech and beyond

## Why Blog?

Writing helps me think more clearly and retain what I learn. If someone else finds it useful — even better!
